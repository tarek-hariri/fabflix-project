This is the final result of a project course in which I made a Netflix-esque imitation website with JSP and Servlet back-end connected to a SQL database, Apache TomCat middleware, and HTML/Javascript front-end. Hosted on AWS. Project also included work with
reCaptcha and SQL Master-Slave Replication.

All work was done by me!
